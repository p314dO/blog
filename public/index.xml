      <description>Exploit iam:CreateLoginProfile to Gain Access to an Amazon S3 Bucket Containing Sensitive Data
The flag is the SSN number of &amp;ldquo;Holly Duncan&amp;rdquo; from the file &amp;ldquo;ssn.csv.&amp;rdquo;
Scenario The goal of this lab is to exploit the iam:CreateLoginProfile vulnerability to grant yourself permissions you should not have. You successfully complete this lab once you access and download sensitive files containing customers&amp;rsquo; personally identifiable information (PII) from Amazon S3 and submit the SSN number of &amp;ldquo;Holly Duncan.</description>

      <title>IAM CreateAccessKey PrivEsc - Cybr</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/iam-createaccesskey-privesc/</link>

      <description>Exploit iam:CreateAccessKey to gain access to an Amazon S3 bucket containing sensitive data that your IAM user does not have permission to access. The flag is the credit card number of &amp;ldquo;Kayla SÃ¡nchez&amp;rdquo; found in the exfiltrated clients file.
Scenario Only high-level administrators should have the iam:CreateAccessKey permission, as an attacker with this permission for other users can create an Access Key ID and Secret Key for that user, allowing them to authenticate as that user.</description>

      <description>As a Penetration Tester, my experience extends to Web Application Security, where I leverage my frontend development background to create secure and user-friendly interfaces. I hold certifications such as eJPT, eWPT, and eWPTX, and I am also diving into the world of cloud security with certifications like ARTA and MCRTA. My goal is to explore and exploit security measures, ensuring users can navigate safely in todayâ€™s ever-evolving digital landscape. I created this blog to share my experiences and deepen my understanding of offensive security.</description>
