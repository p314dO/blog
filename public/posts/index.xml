      <description>Exploit iam:CreateAccessKey to gain access to an Amazon S3 bucket containing sensitive data that your IAM user does not have permission to access. The flag is the credit card number of &amp;ldquo;Kayla SÃ¡nchez&amp;rdquo; found in the exfiltrated clients file.
Scenario Only high-level administrators should have the iam:CreateAccessKey permission, as an attacker with this permission for other users can create an Access Key ID and Secret Key for that user, allowing them to authenticate as that user.</description>
