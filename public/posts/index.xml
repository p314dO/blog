      <description>Exploit iam:CreateAccessKey to gain access to an Amazon S3 bucket containing sensitive data that your IAM user does not have permission to access. The flag is the credit card number of &amp;ldquo;Kayla SÃ¡nchez&amp;rdquo; found in the exfiltrated clients file.
Scenario Only high-level administrators should have the iam:CreateAccessKey permission, as an attacker with this permission for other users can create an Access Key ID and Secret Key for that user, allowing them to authenticate as that user.</description>

      <description>Scenario We have been alerted to a potential security incident. The security team at Huge Logistics has provided AWS keys from an account that recorded unusual activity, along with AWS CloudTrail logs for the time of the activity. We need your expertise to confirm the breach by analyzing the CloudTrail logs, identifying the compromised AWS service, and any data that may have been exfiltrated.
Real-World Context Analyzing AWS CloudTrail logs is a standard practice for detecting suspicious activity within an AWS account, while attackers often target S3 buckets due to the valuable data they may contain.</description>
