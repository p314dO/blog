As a Penetration Tester, my experience extends to Web Application Security, where I leverage my frontend development background to create secure and user-friendly interfaces. I hold certifications such as eJPT, eWPT, and eWPTX, and I am also diving into the world of cloud security with certifications like ARTA and MCRTA. My goal is to explore and exploit security measures, ensuring users can navigate safely in todayâ€™s ever-evolving digital landscape. I created this blog to share my experiences and deepen my understanding of offensive security.
